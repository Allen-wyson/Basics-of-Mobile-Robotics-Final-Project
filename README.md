# EPFL MICRO-452 Fall 2024 Final Project
This is final group project of EPFL MICRO-452 Basics of Mobile Robotics. 
In this project, we had to guide our Thymio robot from a starting point to a finishing point. It needed to follow an optimal path and avoid obstacles. Additionally, it had to be capable of dodging dynamic obstacles (those introduced along its path).
