# EPFL MICRO-452 Fall 2024 Final Project: Mobile Robotics with Thymio

## üìã Project Overview

This repository hosts the final group project for **MICRO-452: Basics of Mobile Robotics** at EPFL.
Our task was to program a Thymio robot to navigate from a starting point to a goal, following an optimal path while avoiding both static and dynamic obstacles. Think of it like giving your robot GPS navigation and reflexes: it plans ahead but also swerves when something suddenly crosses its path.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Global Path Planning**: Compute an optimal route on a given map (e.g., grid, occupancy map).
* **Local Obstacle Avoidance**: React in real time to dynamic obstacles introduced during execution.
* **Smooth Motion Control**: Use velocity profiling and wheel commands to ensure stable travel.
* **Visualization**: Plot planned paths and live robot trajectories for analysis.

## üõ† Prerequisites

* **Thymio II** robot with Aseba firmware
* **Aseba Studio** or **ROS** setup for Thymio (optional)
* **Python 3.8+** with packages: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `networkx`, `opencv-python`
* **Jupyter Notebook** for running the final report
